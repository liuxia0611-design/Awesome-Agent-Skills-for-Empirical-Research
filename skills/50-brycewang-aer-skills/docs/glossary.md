# Glossary

Precise, one-paragraph definitions of the identification, inference, and
editorial terms used across AER-skills. Where a term has a canonical reference,
the bib key into [`../references.bib`](../references.bib) is given in
parentheses. Command-level usage is in the
[methods reference](./methods-reference.md).

The point of this page is disambiguation: many of these terms are used loosely
in seminars and precisely by referees. The referee's meaning is the one below.

---

### Anderson-Rubin (AR) confidence set
A confidence set for the IV coefficient obtained by inverting the AR test. It has
correct coverage *regardless of instrument strength*, so it is the recommended
primary inference for just-identified models instead of the 2SLS `t`-interval,
which over-rejects when instruments are weak (`andrews_stock_sun_2019`).

### ATT(g,t) — group-time average treatment effect
The average treatment effect at calendar time `t` for the cohort first treated at
time `g`. Modern staggered-DiD estimators report ATT(g,t) and then *aggregate*
(simple, dynamic/event-study, or by group) rather than estimating a single
pooled coefficient (`callaway_santanna_2021`).

### Augmented synthetic control (ASCM)
A synthetic control that adds an outcome-model bias correction (e.g. ridge) so it
can be used even when the pre-treatment fit is imperfect, relaxing the strict
convex-hull requirement of classic SCM (`benmichael_feller_rothstein_2021`).

### Bartik / shift-share instrument
An instrument built as the inner product of pre-period exposure *shares* and
aggregate *shocks* (e.g. national industry growth × local industry mix).
Identification can rest on the shares or on the shocks being exogenous — see
*exogenous shares vs. exogenous shocks*.

### booktabs
The LaTeX table style (top/mid/bottom rules, **no vertical lines**) that is the
AER house convention. Captions go *above* tables and *below* figures. See
[`aer-tables-figures`](../skills/aer-tables-figures/SKILL.md).

### Cluster-robust standard errors (CRVE)
Standard errors that allow arbitrary within-cluster correlation. They are
asymptotically valid in the number of *clusters*, not observations, and are
anti-conservative (too small) when clusters are few or very unequal in size — use
the *wild cluster bootstrap* there (`cameron_gelbach_miller_2008`).

### Cross-subfield interest
The actual AER acceptance bar: whether economists *outside* the author's subfield
will read and cite the paper. Technical quality alone routes a paper to a field
journal or the AEJ family. See [`design-principles`](./design-principles.md).

### Data and Code Availability Policy (DCAP)
The AEA policy, enforced by the **AEA Data Editor**, requiring a deposited
replication package (data or access route, code, and a README that runs) before
publication. See [`aer-replication`](../skills/aer-replication/SKILL.md).

### Desk rejection
Rejection by the editor without external review, typically within days. At AER it
is common; at AER: Insights roughly 45% of submissions. The first three pages and
the identification strategy decide it.

### Donut RDD
A regression discontinuity that drops observations in a small window *exactly* at
the cutoff, to test whether the estimate is driven by bunching or manipulation
right at the threshold.

### Doubly robust (DR)
An estimator combining an outcome model and a propensity/weighting model that is
consistent if *either* model is correctly specified. The default `est_method`
for Callaway-Sant'Anna DiD (`callaway_santanna_2021`).

### Effective F (Montiel Olea-Pflueger)
A weak-instrument test statistic valid under heteroskedastic, clustered, or
autocorrelated errors — unlike the classic first-stage `F` and Stock-Yogo
critical values, which assume homoskedasticity (`montielolea_pflueger_2013`).

### Event-study plot
A plot of dynamic treatment-effect coefficients against time-relative-to-
treatment, with the period before treatment (`e = -1`) normalized to zero. Under
staggered adoption it must come from a heterogeneity-robust estimator, not from
TWFE leads and lags.

### Exclusion restriction
The assumption that the instrument affects the outcome *only* through the
endogenous regressor. It is defended by institutional argument and placebo
evidence, never by a statistical test; sensitivity to small violations is
quantified by *plausibly exogenous* bounds (`conley_hansen_rossi_2012`).

### Exogenous shares vs. exogenous shocks
The two mutually exclusive identification routes for a shift-share design.
*Exogenous shares*: the pre-period exposure shares are conditionally as-good-as-
random; diagnose with Rotemberg weights (`goldsmithpinkham_sorkin_swift_2020`).
*Exogenous shocks*: the aggregate shocks are as-good-as-random; do shock-level
inference (`borusyak_hull_jaravel_2022`, `adao_kolesar_morales_2019`).

### Forbidden comparison
In TWFE DiD with staggered timing, a 2×2 comparison that uses *already-treated*
units as controls for *newly-treated* units. When effects are dynamic, these
comparisons receive negative weight and can flip the sign of the estimate; the
*Goodman-Bacon decomposition* quantifies their weight (`goodmanbacon_2021`).

### Fuzzy RDD
A regression discontinuity where crossing the cutoff changes the *probability* of
treatment rather than treatment itself; estimated by IV, scaling the outcome jump
by the first-stage treatment jump.

### Generalized synthetic control (GSC)
An interactive-fixed-effects extension of SCM that handles multiple treated units
and estimates latent factors from the control pool (`xu_2017`).

### Goodman-Bacon decomposition
A decomposition of the TWFE DiD coefficient into a weighted average of all
underlying 2×2 comparisons, exposing how much weight comes from *forbidden
comparisons* (`goodmanbacon_2021`).

### Honest DiD (Rambachan-Roth)
A sensitivity analysis that replaces the untestable exact-parallel-trends
assumption with a bounded one — either *relative magnitudes* (post-trend
violation no larger than `M̄` × the worst pre-trend) or *smoothness* — and reports
the robust confidence set as a function of that bound (`rambachan_roth_2023`).

### Imputation estimator (Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess)
A staggered-DiD estimator that fits the untreated-potential-outcome model on
not-yet-treated observations, imputes the counterfactual, and is efficient under
homoskedasticity (`borusyak_jaravel_spiess_2024`).

### Interaction-weighted estimator (Sun-Abraham)
An event-study estimator that interacts relative-time dummies with cohort
indicators and aggregates with proper weights, avoiding the contamination of
TWFE event-study coefficients (`sun_abraham_2021`).

### Local-linear regression (RDD)
The modern RDD workhorse: a first-order polynomial fit on each side of the cutoff
within an MSE-optimal bandwidth, usually with a triangular kernel that puts most
weight near the threshold (`calonico_cattaneo_titiunik_2014`).

### Manipulation / density test
A test for sorting around the RDD cutoff: if the density of the running variable
jumps at the threshold, units may be manipulating their assignment. Use the
local-polynomial density test (`cattaneo_jansson_ma_2020`), which supersedes the
original McCrary binned estimator (`mccrary_2008`).

### MSE-optimal bandwidth
The bandwidth that minimizes the mean squared error of the local-linear RDD
estimator; paired with a *robust bias-corrected* confidence interval so that the
optimal bandwidth does not invalidate inference (`calonico_cattaneo_titiunik_2014`).

### Multiple-hypothesis correction
Adjustment of p-values or confidence levels when several outcomes/subgroups are
tested, controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate
(FDR). Required when a paper reports many primary outcomes.

### Not-yet-treated control group
Using units that *will* be treated later (but are untreated now) as the
comparison group, which avoids the forbidden comparisons that arise from using
already-treated units as controls.

### openICPSR
The AEA's deposit repository for replication packages. The deposit is reviewed by
the AEA Data Editor against the *DCAP*. See
[`aer-replication`](../skills/aer-replication/SKILL.md).

### Oster's δ (coefficient stability)
A bounding method for omitted-variable bias that asks how strong selection on
unobservables would have to be (relative to observables, `δ`) to explain away the
result — scaling coefficient movement by the accompanying R² movement, not by
coefficient movement alone (`oster_2019`).

### Parallel trends (conditional)
The DiD identifying assumption: absent treatment, treated and control groups
would have followed the same outcome path (possibly after conditioning on
covariates). It is fundamentally untestable; pre-trends and Honest DiD probe it.

### Permutation / Fisher-exact inference
Inference based on re-randomizing or re-assigning treatment across units and
comparing the actual statistic to the resulting null distribution. Standard for
synthetic control (in-space placebo) and randomization inference in experiments.

### Plausibly exogenous (Conley-Hansen-Rossi)
A sensitivity framework for IV that relaxes the exclusion restriction by allowing
the instrument a *bounded* direct effect on the outcome and reporting how the
result changes across that bound (`conley_hansen_rossi_2012`).

### Pre-analysis plan (PAP)
A pre-registered specification of outcomes, subgroups, and the estimating
equation, filed (for AEA-journal field experiments) with the **AEA RCT Registry**
before unblinding. Keeps confirmatory analysis distinct from exploratory.

### Pre-trends joint test
A single test of the joint null that *all* pre-treatment event-study coefficients
equal zero — more informative than eyeballing the plot, but still low-powered,
which is why it is paired with Honest DiD (`roth_2022`).

### Robust bias-corrected (RBC) confidence interval
The RDD confidence interval that recenters for the bias introduced by the
MSE-optimal bandwidth and inflates the variance accordingly; the `rdrobust`
default (`calonico_cattaneo_titiunik_2014`).

### Rotemberg weights
The weights that reveal which exposure *shares* drive a Bartik/shift-share
estimate. Reporting them — and inspecting the top-weighted shares for
plausibility — is the key diagnostic under the exogenous-shares interpretation
(`goldsmithpinkham_sorkin_swift_2020`).

### Sharp RDD
A regression discontinuity where treatment is a *deterministic* step function of
the running variable at the cutoff (everyone above is treated, everyone below is
not).

### Specification curve
A display of the estimate across the full set of defensible analytic choices,
converting "you picked your specification" into a visible distribution of results
(`simonsohn_simmons_nelson_2020`).

### Synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID)
An estimator that combines synthetic-control unit weights with DiD time weighting,
relaxing both the parallel-trends assumption of DiD and the perfect-pre-fit
requirement of SCM (`arkhangelsky_etal_2021`).

### tF adjustment
A correction that maps the just-identified IV `t`-ratio to a weak-IV-robust
critical value (popularized as the "use `|t| > 3`, not `1.96`" rule), giving
correct size without computing the full AR set (`lee_mccrary_moreira_porter_2022`).

### TWFE (two-way fixed effects)
The regression of an outcome on a treatment dummy with unit and time fixed
effects. Unbiased for a single simultaneous treatment with homogeneous effects;
biased — sometimes sign-flipped — under staggered timing with dynamic effects
(`dechaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_2020`).

### Weak instrument
An instrument only mildly correlated with the endogenous regressor, which biases
2SLS toward OLS and destroys the size of conventional `t`-tests. Diagnosed with
the *effective F* and handled with *AR* / *tF* inference, not the `F > 10` rule
of thumb.

### Wild cluster bootstrap
A bootstrap that resamples cluster-level residual signs to produce p-values and
confidence intervals valid with *few* or *unequal* clusters, where cluster-robust
SEs fail (`cameron_gelbach_miller_2008`, `mackinnon_webb_2017`).
